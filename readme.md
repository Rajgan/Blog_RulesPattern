# The Rules Design Pattern #

Sample code from my [blog post](http://michael-whelan.net/rules-design-pattern) about dealing with complex conditional logic with the Rules design pattern.

I first came across the Rules Pattern as a module that [Steve Smith](http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/steve-smith) contributed to Pluralsightâ€™s [Design Patterns library](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/patterns-library).
